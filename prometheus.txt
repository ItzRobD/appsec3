The writer of this has done some weird things. For some reason it looks like they're adding the inputted
passwords to the graph dict as a key. I can't see that being a good thing so I've removed that around line 50.
I also don't think we need to track the number of registers and logins. If any passwords are exposed
in that process it could be bad.

To expand monitoring throughout the code 404 errors are being raised. I created a counter for these
and added it to where ever I saw a raised 404 error. That could be useful if things break on the back end.

To get prometheus working and able to monitor the service I used the following commands in order:

curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
sh ./get_helm.sh
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
helm repo update
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus
export KUBE_EDITOR="nano"
kubectl get configmap
kubectl edit configmap prometheus-server
kubectl expose service prometheus-server --type=NodePort --target-port=9090 --name=prometheus-server-np
minikube service prometheus-server-np

During this process I was able to edit the yaml config file for prometheus. I added a new job for the
GiftCard Site and changed some of the timing because I thought some were too long to give good results.
I was able to export this file as kubectl-edit-1264040570.yaml

While on the prometheus ui site I was able to see that I was connected to the gift card site service
and I was able to view metrics.
