To find the secrets within the application I grepped through the app folder looking for secret.

I ran: grep -riIn "secret" .

I was given the following pertinent output:

./GiftcardSite/k8/django-deploy.yaml:37:                secretKeyRef:
./GiftcardSite/k8/django-deploy.yaml:38:                    name: admin-login-secrets
./GiftcardSite/k8/django-deploy.yaml:43:                secretKeyRef:
./GiftcardSite/k8/django-deploy.yaml:44:                    name: admin-login-secrets
./GiftcardSite/k8/django-admin-pass-secret.yaml:2:kind: Secret
./GiftcardSite/k8/django-admin-pass-secret.yaml:4:    name: admin-login-secrets
./GiftcardSite/GiftcardSite/settings.py:23:# SECURITY WARNING: keep the secret key used in production secret!
./GiftcardSite/GiftcardSite/settings.py:24:SECRET_KEY = 'kmgysa#fz+9(z1*=c0ydrjizk*7sthm2ga1z4=^61$cxcq8b$l'

I also wanted to see if anything was stored as a password that could be an issue.

I ran grep -riIn "password" .

I was given the following pertinent output:

./GiftcardSite/k8/django-deploy.yaml:23:            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
./GiftcardSite/k8/django-deploy.yaml:45:                    key: password
./GiftcardSite/k8/django-admin-pass-secret.yaml:8:    password: dGhpc2lzYXRlc3R0aGluZy4=
./GiftcardSite/GiftcardSite/settings.py:88:        'PASSWORD': os.environ.get('MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD'),


Within django-deploy.yaml is the following:

          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: thisisatestthing. 
			  
This will need to change as well so I wanted to see where this would be.

I ran grep -riIn "thisisatestthing." .

I was given the following pertinent output:

./GiftcardSite/k8/django-deploy.yaml:24:              value: thisisatestthing. 
./db/k8/db-deployment.yaml:21:              value: thisisatestthing.
./db/k8s/db-deployment.yaml:21:              value: thisisatestthing.


To start making these changes I followed the instructions on creating a secrets file and used cyberchef to translate the secret key and and user/pass
to base64. This is stored in test-secret.yaml

I changed the secret key variable in settings.py to get it from this new file. Then modified the django-deploy.yaml and db-deployment to do the same.
I don't think we are using k8s so I left that one alone

When I rebuilt this I had to make sure to include the secret by running:

kubectl apply -f test-secret.yaml

After doing this I was able to connect to the site again without any issues so I believe everything is working properly.
