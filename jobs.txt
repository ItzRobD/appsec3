I need to use a kubernetes job to handle the django migrations so I created a yaml file for this named django-migration.yaml.
It will run the manage.py migrate command using the environment variables we need.

Just like the secrets in order to use this we need to run the following command:

kubectl apply -f django-migration.yaml

To seed the db using a job I created the seeding.yaml file which contains the job.
This will run a similar file to setup.sql called seeding.sql which will load the products and users to the table.
In order to make sure this isn't done the previous way I edited the dockerfile to
copy the csvs to a seeding directory which seeding.sql is pointing to.

After this job runs, I get a bash shell by using

kubectl exec -it pod/mysql-container-c75989f96-8dlxz /bin/bash

Then I can log in to the mysql database and use show tables to see they exist

mysql> show tables;
